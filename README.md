# Shape-Up-and-Shape-Out
Basic: Input the dimensions of a shape and it will appear on the page in a random position.

In this lab I created a palet for the shapes to be displayed onto when you type their dimensions in. You can enter the dimensions of either a square, rectangle, circle, or triangle. Each of the shapes have a specific color so you can more quickly tell them apart and it looks cooler. The shapes are displayed in a random position of the canvas and you can single click on them to get the dimensions of that specific shape or double click to remove it from the canvas. Try it out!
